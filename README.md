# Sparse Matrix Operations

This Python script performs various operations on sparse matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It reads matrix data from text files, performs the specified operation, and writes the result to a new file.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on sparse matrices.
- **File Input/Output:** Read matrix data from text files and write results to new files.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors for invalid matrix dimensions and file operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies required

## Usage

1. Place input matrix files in the `sample_inputs` directory.
2. Run the script and follow the prompts to select input files and operation.
3. The result will be saved in the `output` directory with a unique filename.

File Structure
sparse_matrix_operations.py: The main Python script for matrix operations.
sample_inputs/: Directory containing sample input matrix files.
output/: Directory where result files are saved.
